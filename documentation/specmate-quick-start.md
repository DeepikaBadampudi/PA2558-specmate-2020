Specmate Getting Started Guide

# Installation, Configuration & Startup

## Installation

-Make sure you have Java 1.8 installed. If not, obtain a Java 1.8 release, e.g. from here. To find out which Java version you are currently running, go to a console and type java -version.

-Obtain the latest Specmate relase from the download page.

-Unzip Specmate to a folder of your choice.

-On Windows run start.bat, on Linux/Mac run start.sh

## Configuration
Specmate is configured via the file specmate-config.properties. You can obtain a sample configuration file from here.

### Adding new projects
Specmate is structured in projects. A project represents a space for requirements, models and tests that can be accessed by a group of users. 
For each project you can configure a requirement source and an export target for test-procedures. 
To add a new project, add the project id to the project list via the property project.projects

Example:
project.projects = myproject1, myproject2

### Adding requirements sources
Specmate supports different kinds of requirements sources:
- Requirements files
- JIRA
- HP PPM

Currently, the requirements sources also define which users can access the project. E.g. if you configure a JIRA requirements source, every user that has access to the JIRA instance, will be able to access the project.

#### Requirement from Files
To configure a requirement file source for a project, provide the location of a folder on your file system. Specmate will search for *.txt files in this folder and import the requirements contained in these files.
The format of the requirement files is as follows:

[Requirement-ID]
[Requirement-Text (may not contain blank lines)]

[Requirement-ID]
[Requirement-Text (may not contain blank lines)]
...

A requirement file location for a project is configured as follows:

project.[project-id].connector.pid = com.specmate.FileConnector
project.[project-id].connector.fileConnector.folder = [location on file system]
project.[project-id].connector.fileConnector.user = [user name]
project.[project-id].connector.fileConnector.password = [password]
project.[project-id].connector.connectorID = [project-id]

#### JIRA Import

## Starting Specmate
In order to start specmate enter a terminal and type
java -jar specmate.jar -configurationFile [path-to-your-config-file]

Now, you can open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to access the Specmate front page.
 
# Usage

## Login
On the Specmate front page, select a project and enter a valid login for this project. Note that the credentials are generally specific for a certain project and will not work for every project.

## Overview
After logging in to Specmate you see the following views

- On the right you see the project explorer. The project explorer shows the imported requirements in a tree. You can navigate through the tree (i.e. open the folders) and select a requirement.
- In the project explorer you can switch between the project view showing the imported requirements and the library view. In the library you can freely add folders and models.
- Above the project explorer is a search field. On entering a keyword the project explorer shows requirements and models matching the keyword. Note that currently the library is not included in the search.
- In the top section of the screen right beside the Specmate logo, you find buttons to saving the currently opened model, for navigation back and forth and to undo the last action in an model editor.
